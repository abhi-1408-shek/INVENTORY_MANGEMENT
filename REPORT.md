# Inventory Management System â€“ Project Report

## Introduction
The Inventory Management System is a robust desktop solution designed to streamline the management of products, suppliers, categories, and inventory transactions for retail and warehouse environments. Built with JavaFX and MySQL, the system prioritizes usability, data integrity, and actionable business analytics.

## Objectives
- Simplify inventory, supplier, and category management
- Enable real-time tracking of stock and transactions
- Provide analytics and reporting for business decision-making
- Ensure data consistency and security

## System Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Persistence:** Data Access Object (DAO) for all DB operations
- **Database:** MySQL, normalized schema with foreign key constraints
- **UI:** JavaFX (modern, responsive, with charts and dashboards)

## Database Schema
- **categories:** id (PK), name (unique)
- **suppliers:** id (PK), name, contact_info
- **products:** id (PK), name, category_id (FK), supplier_id (FK), price, stock
- **transactions:** id (PK), product_id (FK), quantity, date, type (sale/purchase)

## Implementation Details
- **JavaFX UI:** Modern forms, tables, dashboards, and navigation
- **DAO Layer:** Encapsulates CRUD, prevents SQL injection, ensures separation of concerns
- **Real-Time Updates:** Observable lists for instant UI refresh
- **Reporting:** Export inventory and sales data to CSV/PDF
- **Testing:** Manual and automated UI and DB tests

## Features
- Add, edit, delete products, suppliers, categories
- Manage and log inventory transactions (sales, purchases)
- Dashboard with live charts for stock and sales trends
- Data export (CSV/PDF)
- User-friendly navigation, error handling, and tooltips

## Testing
- Manual testing of all modules (CRUD, navigation, reporting)
- Automated tests for DAO/database layer
- Cross-verification of report data with direct SQL queries

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Database Access Errors:** Resolved by standardizing configuration, guiding password resets, and clean reinstallation
- **MySQL Permissions:** Addressed by clear documentation and secure installation
- **UI Responsiveness:** Improved with JavaFX threading and observable lists
- **Data Integrity:** Enforced with foreign keys and transaction management

## Team Contributions & Project Division
